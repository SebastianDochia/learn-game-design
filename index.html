        <p>Get started with the basics of game design. Learn everything you need to get started with the adventure that
            is game making. Get a grasp on what makes a game fun and how to keep the player enganged for long periods of
            time.</p>

            <h2>1.Ideas</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><q><i>Every good idea borders on the stupid.</i></q> ~ Michel Gondry</p>
            <p>I like this quote because many game ideas often sound stupid. Try these on for size:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A yellow creature eats dots while being chased by ghost monsters.</li>
                <li>A plumber jumps on the heads of mushrooms to find his girlfriend.</li>
                <li>A prince rebuilds stars by rolling balls of junk into bigger balls of junk.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of those stupid - sounding ideas ended up being games that made lots
                and lots of money. I guess they aren ’ t so stupid after all. To me, the lesson
                is, never dismiss a game idea, even if it does sound stupid. </p>
            <p>So, where do I get my own stupid ideas to turn into video games? The
                traditional way to get an idea is to get inspired. The good news is that a
                good game idea can come from anywhere. Here is a list of things I do to
                get inspired. I suggest you try them yourself the next time you need to come
                up with an idea</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read something you normally wouldn ’ t read.</li>
                <li>Take a walk, drive or shower</li>
                <li>Attend a lecture</li>
                <li>Play a game, preferably a bad one. </li>
                <li>Regardless of the above, follow your passion. </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="resources/carefreeGuy.png" />
            <p style="text-align: center;"><q><i>If you think something is innovative, it just means you haven ’ t been
                        paying
                        attention. </i></q> ~ Scott Rogers </p>
            <p>While I am sure there is probably still a completely original idea out there in
                the galaxy of ideas, the majority of gameplay design works by each game
                building upon its predecessor. I truly believe that this strategy is one of the
                keys to creating great game design. Even the most innovative games like
                the aforementioned PaRappa, Sims, and Braid had their predecessors in
                Simon, Sim City6
                , and Blinx: the Time Sweeper. </p>

            <h2>2.Writing the story</h2>
            <p>Almost since the dawn of gaming, designers have debated which is more
                important: story or gameplay? Some designers believe games require a
                story to engage the player. Other designers think a story is what people
                use to describe play when it is finished. Pro - story designers reply that
                games are an artistic medium used to tell a story. Anti - story designers
                counter that a story is what you watch while the game loads. Designers at
                Game Developer Conferences all around the world face off against each
                other: one group yelling “Bioshock! ” while the other side shouts “Doom! ”
                back. Silly designers. They are both right and wrong. A game doesn ’ t need
                to have a story, and yet it always has a story. Perplexing? While you are
                chewing that over, let ’ s look at the classical definition of “ story ” as taught
                by everyone from Aristotle to very famous screenwriters. Here ’ s the most
                basic structure of a story:</p>

            <p>Remember that no matter what your story is about, a story
                ALWAYS has a beginning, middle, and end. Hollywood
                has spent many years analyzing and deconstructing the
                story. Don’t feel like you have to reinvent the wheel; learn
                what they have. Read screenwriting books, take classes,
                visit screenwriting websites. But you don’t have to feel
                chained to a standard story structure like Joseph
                Campbell’s “Hero’s Journey” or Syd Field’s “Three Act Structure.” Try
                using another medium’s structures to tell your story. How is a story told
                in a song? In a TV news report? In a Homeric poem? Or try looking to
                non - Western - world storytelling for inspiration. </p>
            <p>Just remember that video games are an interactive medium, and as William
                Shakespeare reminds us, “The play’s the thing.” That was one guy who
                knew story, and he was pretty smart for someone who never played a video
                game. If gameplay is the meat of the game, then story should be the salt:
                just enough will add flavor but too much can ruin everything and kill you. </p>
            <p>Monty Python and the Holy Grail features typical (if not archetypical)
                characters: King Arthur and his knights of the round table. These stalwart
                knights travel through medieval England on their quest for the Holy Grail.
                However, that quest is filled with weird activities like designing shrubs for
                the knights that say “Ni!” or being slaughtered by the killer rabbit of
                Caerbannog. </p>

            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION</strong></p>
            <p>Let this rule be your motto when designing anything. It will come into play
                more importantly later on in the book, but should be your guide especially
                when designing your game character. There are several great books on how to design a character visually
                , so I won’t go into great detail about this, but
                let me pass on some of the high level things to keep in mind. </p>
            <p>As you are creating your character, you want to think about his or her
                personality. What are the three personality traits that you would use to
                describe your hero?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mario:</strong> courageous, bouncy, happy </li>
                <li><strong>Sonic:</strong> fast, cool, edgy</li>
                <li><strong>Kratos:</strong> brutal, vicious, selfish </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Another old trick that all professional character designers and animators use
                is the silhouette. A strong, clear silhouette of a character is important for
                many reasons: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tells us the character ’ s personality at a glance. </li>
                <li>Helps distinguish one character from another. </li>
                <li>Identifi es “ friendly ” or “ enemy ” characters. </li>
                <li>Helps the character stand out against background and world elements. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, let ’ s look at the silhouettes of the player characters of Team
                Fortress 2. </p>
            <img src="resources/tf2.png"/>
            <p>Due to their unique silhouettes, you can immediately distinguish one
                character from another. In the image above, the Heavy is clearly
                distinguished from the Pyro from the Spy. Body language plays a huge part
                in creating unique personalities. Not only does their silhouette give you a
                snapshot of their personality, but it provides the player with a quick way to
                recognize the character. This is important during gameplay so you know
                who is gunning for you and can adjust your strategy — or more importantly,
                who is in your sights. Boom. Headshot. </p>
